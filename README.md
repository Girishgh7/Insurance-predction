Insurance Prediction Model
This repository contains code for predicting insurance costs using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that accurately estimates insurance premiums based on various features such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and relationships between features.

Model Building: Implementing multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters using Grid Search and Cross-Validation.
